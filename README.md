# ChatOn
A realtime chat application based on flask and socket.io powered by MySql database


* __Multiple Rooms__: Using `Flask-Socketio` different rooms are created for different types of discussions.
* __Profanity Filtering__: Using `better-profanity` python module all swear words (and their leetspeak) are removed from message strings.
* __Live Chat__:  all messages are sent to the Python web server, and then broadcast back to all clients.
* __Register/Login__: Using `flask-sqlalchemy` all users are registered and can login again with same username-password.
